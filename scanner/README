This directory contains the instructors' tests used to evaluate
the scanner assignment, in addition to the students' submitted
tests.  good*.cminor should scan correctly, and bad*.cminor should not.
Note that the good files will not necessarily parse, typecheck,
or compile, they are just sequences of valid tokens.

Note that run_all_tests.sh will quickly test your compiler on
all the tests, assuming that it is in your path and produces
a proper exit code from main (which it should!)
